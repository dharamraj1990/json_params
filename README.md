# Lambda Functions CI/CD Workflow

This repository contains a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically builds Docker images and pushes them to AWS ECR when Lambda function code changes are detected.

## Features

- ✅ **Automatic Change Detection**: Detects which Lambda function folders have changed
- ✅ **Parallel Builds**: Builds multiple Lambda functions in parallel when multiple folders are changed
- ✅ **ECR Integration**: Pushes images to respective ECR repositories for each Lambda function
- ✅ **Smart Tagging**: Tags images with commit SHA and Lambda function name
- ✅ **Fail-Safe**: Continues building other images even if one fails
- ✅ **Multi-Environment Deployment**: Auto-deploy to dev, manual approval for staging and production
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Automatic retry logic and conflict resolution for Lambda updates

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create ECR Repository

Create a **single ECR repository** for all Lambda functions:

```bash
# Set your AWS region
export AWS_REGION=us-east-1

# Create single ECR repository
aws ecr create-repository \
  --repository-name lambda-function-1-repo \
  --region $AWS_REGION \
  --image-scanning-configuration scanOnPush=true
```

**Note:** 
- Only **one ECR repository** is needed for all Lambda functions
- Images are tagged with the Lambda function name (e.g., `lambda-function-1-<commit-sha>`)
- Make sure AWS credentials are configured (`aws configure`) before running commands

### 2. Image Tagging Convention

The workflow uses a **single ECR repository** and tags images by Lambda function name:

- **ECR Repository**: `lambda-function-1-repo` (single repository for all functions)
- **Image Tag**: `<lambda-function-name>-<commit-sha>`

**Examples:**
- `lambda-function-1` → `lambda-function-1-repo:lambda-function-1-abc123def456`
- `lambda-function-2` → `lambda-function-1-repo:lambda-function-2-abc123def456`
- `lambda-function-3` → `lambda-function-1-repo:lambda-function-3-abc123def456`

This allows you to:
- Store all Lambda images in one repository
- Easily identify which Lambda function each image belongs to
- Track versions using commit SHA in the tag

### 3. Set Up AWS OIDC Authentication

The workflow uses **OIDC (OpenID Connect)** for secure authentication without storing access keys.

#### Step 1: Configure GitHub OIDC Provider in AWS

1. **Create an OIDC Identity Provider in AWS IAM**:
   - Go to IAM → Identity providers → Add provider
   - Provider type: **OpenID Connect**
   - Provider URL: `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`
   - Audience: `sts.amazonaws.com`
   - Click **Add provider**

2. **Create IAM Role for GitHub Actions**:
   - Go to IAM → Roles → Create role
   - Trust entity type: **Web identity**
   - Identity provider: Select the GitHub OIDC provider you just created
   - Audience: `sts.amazonaws.com`
   - Add condition:
     - Key: `StringEquals`
     - Key: `token.actions.githubusercontent.com:aud`
     - Value: `sts.amazonaws.com`
   - Add another condition (optional, for security):
     - Key: `StringLike`
     - Key: `token.actions.githubusercontent.com:sub`
     - Value: `repo:YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME:*`
   - Role name: `oidc-github-action` (or update `OIDC_ROLE_NAME` in workflow)
   - Attach policies with required permissions (see below)

#### Step 2: Configure AWS Account Numbers (Optional)

If you have different AWS accounts for different environments, add these GitHub Secrets:

- `AWS_ACCOUNT_DEV` - AWS account number for dev environment (default: `533269020590`)
- `AWS_ACCOUNT_STAGING` - AWS account number for staging environment (default: `533269020590`)
- `AWS_ACCOUNT_PROD` - AWS account number for production environment (default: `533269020590`)

If not set, all environments will use account `533269020590`.

#### Step 3: Required IAM Permissions

The IAM role needs the following permissions:

**ECR Permissions** (for building and pushing images):
- `ecr:GetAuthorizationToken`
- `ecr:BatchCheckLayerAvailability`
- `ecr:GetDownloadUrlForLayer`
- `ecr:BatchGetImage`
- `ecr:PutImage`
- `ecr:InitiateLayerUpload`
- `ecr:UploadLayerPart`
- `ecr:CompleteLayerUpload`
- `ecr:DescribeRepositories`
- `ecr:DescribeImages`
- `ecr:ListImages`

**Lambda Permissions** (for deploying functions):
- `lambda:UpdateFunctionCode`
- `lambda:GetFunction`
- `lambda:GetFunctionConfiguration`

**Resource ARNs**:
- ECR: `arn:aws:ecr:*:*:repository/lambda-function-*`
- Lambda: `arn:aws:lambda:*:*:function:*-us-east-lambda-*`

#### Step 4: Update Workflow (Already Configured)

The workflow is already configured to use OIDC with the role:
- Role ARN pattern: `arn:aws:iam::{account-id}:role/oidc-github-action`
- Each environment uses its respective AWS account number

### 4. Manual Approval Setup (Works on Free GitHub Accounts)

**IMPORTANT**: The workflow uses manual approval via GitHub Issues, which works on **free GitHub accounts** (no Enterprise required).

#### How Manual Approval Works:

The workflow automatically creates GitHub Issues for staging and production deployments that require approval:

1. **Staging Deployment**:
   - After images are built and pushed, an approval job runs
   - A GitHub Issue is created with title: "🚀 Staging Deployment Approval Required"
   - The workflow pauses and waits for approval

2. **Production Deployment**:
   - After images are built and pushed, an approval job runs
   - A GitHub Issue is created with title: "🚀 Production Deployment Approval Required"
   - The workflow pauses and waits for approval

#### How to Approve or Reject:

When an approval issue is created:

1. **Go to the Issues tab** in your repository
2. **Find the approval issue** (it will be automatically created)
3. **Comment on the issue**:
   - Type `/approve` to approve the deployment
   - Type `/reject` to reject the deployment
4. **The workflow will automatically continue** once approved (or fail if rejected)

#### Configuration:

The approval is configured to use the person who triggered the workflow (`${{ github.actor }}`) as the approver. To change this:

1. Edit `.github/workflows/lambda-build-push.yml`
2. Find the `approve-staging` and `approve-production` jobs
3. Update the `approvers` field with GitHub usernames (comma-separated):
   ```yaml
   approvers: username1,username2,username3
   ```
4. Adjust `minimum-approvals` if you need multiple approvals

#### Deployment Flow:

- **Dev Environment**: Deploys automatically (no approval needed)
- **Staging Environment**: Requires manual approval via GitHub Issue
- **Production Environment**: Requires manual approval via GitHub Issue

**Note**: This approach works on free GitHub accounts and doesn't require GitHub Enterprise or paid plans.

### 5. Configure Workflow Settings

Edit `.github/workflows/lambda-build-push.yml`:

- Update `AWS_REGION` in the `env` section (default: `us-east-1`)
- Update branch names if different from `main` or `develop`
- Adjust paths if your Lambda functions are in a different directory

### 6. Create Lambda Function Folders

For each Lambda function, create a folder under `lambda-functions/` with:

- **Dockerfile**: Docker configuration for building the Lambda image
- **requirements.txt**: Python dependencies
- **lambda_function.py**: Your Lambda handler code

Example Dockerfile:
```dockerfile
FROM public.ecr.aws/lambda/python:3.11
WORKDIR ${LAMBDA_TASK_ROOT}
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
CMD [ "lambda_function.lambda_handler" ]
```

## How It Works

1. **Change Detection**: When code is pushed, the workflow detects which folders under `lambda-functions/` have changed
2. **Parallel Execution**: For each changed folder, a separate build job runs in parallel
3. **Image Building**: Each job builds a Docker image for its Lambda function
4. **ECR Push**: Images are tagged with `<lambda-name>-<commit-sha>`, then pushed to the ECR repository
5. **Deployment**:
   - **Dev**: Automatically deploys to Lambda functions (no approval)
   - **Staging**: Waits for manual approval, then deploys
   - **Production**: Waits for manual approval, then deploys

## Workflow Triggers

The workflow runs on:
- Push to any branch (only if files in `lambda-functions/` change)
- Pull requests to `main`, `develop`, or `staging` branches (only if files in `lambda-functions/` change)

## Advanced Branching Strategy

The workflow implements a sophisticated branching strategy that automatically determines which environment to deploy to based on the branch name:

### Branch Types and Deployment Behavior

| Branch Pattern | Branch Type | Build | Deploy Dev | Deploy Staging | Deploy Production |
|---------------|-------------|-------|------------|----------------|-------------------|
| `main` / `master` | Main | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ (with approval) |
| `develop` / `dev` | Develop | ✅ | ✅ (automatic) | ❌ | ❌ |
| `staging` | Staging | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ (with approval) | ❌ |
| `release/*` / `release-*` | Release | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ (with approval) | ❌ |
| `hotfix/*` / `hotfix-*` | Hotfix | ✅ | ✅ (automatic) | ✅ (with approval) | ✅ (with approval) |
| `feature/*` / `feat/*` | Feature | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Pull Requests | PR | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Other branches | Unknown | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

### Branch Strategy Details

#### 1. **Main Branch** (`main` / `master`)
- **Purpose**: Production deployments
- **Build**: ✅ Yes
- **Deploy**: Production only (with manual approval)
- **Use Case**: Stable, production-ready code

#### 2. **Develop Branch** (`develop` / `dev`)
- **Purpose**: Development environment
- **Build**: ✅ Yes
- **Deploy**: Dev environment only (automatic, no approval)
- **Use Case**: Active development and testing

#### 3. **Staging/Release Branches** (`staging`, `release/*`, `release-*`)
- **Purpose**: Pre-production testing
- **Build**: ✅ Yes
- **Deploy**: Staging environment only (with manual approval)
- **Use Case**: Final testing before production

#### 4. **Hotfix Branches** (`hotfix/*`, `hotfix-*`)
- **Purpose**: Critical production fixes
- **Build**: ✅ Yes
- **Deploy**: All environments (Dev automatic, Staging/Prod with approval)
- **Use Case**: Urgent fixes that need to bypass normal flow

#### 5. **Feature Branches** (`feature/*`, `feat/*`, `feature-*`, `feat-*`)
- **Purpose**: New feature development
- **Build**: ✅ Yes
- **Deploy**: ❌ No deployment (build only)
- **Use Case**: Isolated feature development

#### 6. **Pull Requests**
- **Purpose**: Code review and validation
- **Build**: ✅ Yes
- **Deploy**: ❌ No deployment (build only)
- **Use Case**: Validate changes before merging

### Deployment Flow Examples

#### Example 1: Feature Development
```
feature/new-api → Build only → No deployment
     ↓
develop → Build + Deploy to Dev (automatic)
     ↓
staging → Build + Deploy to Staging (with approval)
     ↓
main → Build + Deploy to Production (with approval)
```

#### Example 2: Hotfix
```
hotfix/critical-bug → Build + Deploy to Dev (automatic)
                    → Deploy to Staging (with approval)
                    → Deploy to Production (with approval)
```

#### Example 3: Release
```
release/v1.2.0 → Build + Deploy to Staging (with approval)
     ↓
main → Build + Deploy to Production (with approval)
```

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Single Folder Changed
- Change made to `lambda-functions/lambda-function-1/`
- Only `lambda-function-1` image is built and pushed to its ECR repo

### Scenario 2: Multiple Folders Changed
- Changes made to `lambda-functions/lambda-function-1/` and `lambda-functions/lambda-function-3/`
- Both images are built in parallel and pushed to their respective ECR repos

### Scenario 3: No Lambda Function Changes
- Changes made outside `lambda-functions/` directory
- Workflow detects no changes and skips execution

## Image Tags

Each image is tagged with:
- **Lambda Name + Commit SHA**: `<lambda-function-name>-<commit-sha>` (for traceability)

Example:
- `123456789.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/lambda-function-1-repo:lambda-function-1-abc123def456`
- `123456789.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/lambda-function-1-repo:lambda-function-2-abc123def456`

## Deployment Flow

### Automatic Deployment (Dev)
- Triggers on: `develop`/`dev` branches, `hotfix/*` branches
- No approval required
- Updates Lambda functions: `dev-us-east-lambda-1`, `dev-us-east-lambda-2`, etc.

### Manual Approval (Staging)
- Triggers on: `staging` branch, `release/*` branches, `hotfix/*` branches
- Requires manual approval via GitHub Issue
- Workflow creates an approval issue and waits for `/approve` comment
- Once approved, deployment proceeds automatically
- Updates Lambda functions: `stg-us-east-lambda-1`, `stg-us-east-lambda-2`, etc.

### Manual Approval (Production)
- Triggers on: `main`/`master` branch, `hotfix/*` branches
- Requires manual approval via GitHub Issue
- Workflow creates an approval issue and waits for `/approve` comment
- Once approved, deployment proceeds automatically
- Updates Lambda functions: `prd-us-east-lambda-1`, `prd-us-east-lambda-2`, etc.

### Build Only (No Deployment)
- Triggers on: `feature/*` branches, Pull Requests, other branches
- Images are built and pushed to ECR
- No Lambda function deployment
- Useful for validation and testing

## Troubleshooting

### Workflow not triggering
- Ensure changes are in `lambda-functions/` directory
- Check that workflow file is in `.github/workflows/` directory
- Verify branch names match your repository

### ECR push fails
- Verify AWS credentials are correctly configured
- Check IAM permissions for ECR operations
- Ensure ECR repositories exist and names match the mapping file

### Build fails
- Check Dockerfile syntax
- Verify all dependencies in requirements.txt are valid
- Check Lambda handler path in Dockerfile CMD

## Customization

### Change AWS Region
Update `AWS_REGION` in the workflow file's `env` section.

### Change Branch Names
Update the `on.push.branches` section in the workflow file.

### Change Lambda Function Directory
Update the `paths` filter and folder detection logic in the workflow.

### Add Environment Variables
Add environment variables to the workflow or use GitHub Secrets for sensitive values.

## Security Best Practices

1. ✅ Use IAM roles instead of access keys when possible
2. ✅ Limit IAM permissions to only what's needed (ECR operations)
3. ✅ Use GitHub Secrets for sensitive information
4. ✅ Enable ECR image scanning in AWS
5. ✅ Use specific image tags (commit SHA) instead of `latest` in production
